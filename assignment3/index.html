Tarot card meanings were imported from a spreadsheet linked in this Reddit post:

<!-- This prototype draws inspiration from real-life tarot reading, where a 78-card deck holds distinct meanings. 
 Tarot is seen as a mystical practice, a powerful intuitive tool for divination, personal development, and rediscovering inspiration. 
 This project offers users a subjective, entertaining tarot experience without needing a physical deck.

Fortunately, I had some background in creative coding with JavaScript and p5.js from last semester, which helped me develop this. 
To convey a mystical vibe, I chose a falu red background with Patriot font at 24px for headings and Georgia font at 18px for body text. -->
