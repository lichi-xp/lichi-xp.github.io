          Behance's main page displays a grid of thumbnail images representing

        <p>
          Similarly, Richbrown's portfolio website reflects this design and

        [Q. 13] What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
        what makes that part satisfying?

              The website tends to lag when navigating between pages, which
              significantly affects user interaction. Even if the site has many
              engaging and interesting interactive effects, lag can prevent
              users from fully experiencing them and may lead to frustration,
              causing them to leave due to interruptions.

              When the website frame is resized to half its width, the interface
              switches to a mobile layout. This change causes the mouse cursor
              to disappear, making it difficult to track its position and
              continue interacting with the site.

              There is an element that resembles an arrow button, suggesting it
              could be clicked to move to the next section. However, it is
              merely a design element without any functional purpose, which can
              be misleading for users.

              It takes considerable time to find and test the buttons needed to
              return to the previous position when navigating within the project
              detail page, which can be frustrating for users.

              The use of uppercase fonts throughout the site discourages users
              from reading the text and makes it challenging to follow along.
              This issue is supported by an article from the Nielsen Norman

            <p>
              The use of small, uppercase text makes it difficult to quickly
              locate specific information. For instance, when trying to visit an
              external project link, users must carefully read through
              subheadings to find the relevant link.

            <p>
              The text within the "B" button section is too small. This section
              contains Q&A content, but the questions and answers are written
              continuously without line breaks or adequate spacing, making it
              difficult to distinguish between them.

            <p>
              While horizontal and vertical scrolling is possible on the project
              detail page, the homepage only allows vertical scrolling, despite
              horizontal scrolling being used in the project section. This
              inconsistency creates a lack of uniformity and flexibility in the
              user experience.
