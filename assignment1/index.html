    <p>
      The original mouse icon has been replaced with a small circle that
      includes a motion trail, enhancing the cursor's visibility for users due
      to its compact size.
    </p>
    <p>

      video, paired with the bold, uppercase title "Rich Brown," which
      prominently stands out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall design is clean, modern, and minimalist, which reflects an
      intuitive, straightforward, and professional approach that effectively
      showcases the designer's personal style.

    <h2>
      [Q. 02] Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
      your discrete actions.
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Move the mouse around the homepage to interact with the motion trail.
      </li>
      <li>Select the contact information button.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to explore the page content.</li>
      <li>
        Notice text and images tilting left-right based on scroll direction, but
        it's unclear what the information is.
      </li>
      <li>Select and skip through the introduction video, then close it.</li>
      <li>
        Hover over the Bathmate image, moving the mouse around its border to see
        the 3D tilting motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the project overview, the background color changes with each project
        image hovered over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hover through the project archive, mainly viewing images to understand
        project content, then scroll back for details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the Bathmate image to navigate to a new page with detailed
        project information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scroll through the Bathmate project detail page, which moves
        horizontally, skipping text.
      </li>
      <li>Mistakenly thought the "--|" was a navigation arrow.</li>
      <li>
        Look for a button to return to the homepage, thinking the rotating icon
        in the top right might be it, clicking surrounding icons to test, then
        find that the "R" button on the top right is -the way back to the
        homepage.
      </li>
      <li>Click the "B" button, see too much text, and close it.</li>
